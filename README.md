# Service-Bus-Message-Queue-Demo

Two sample console applications to demo Azure Service Bus Queues. 

In order for the above projects to run you will need to create an Azure Service Bus Queue using the Azure Portal (https://manage.windowsazure.com). Once you have created the queue you will need to replace the endpoint URLs and the queue name in the Program.cs file of each project.
